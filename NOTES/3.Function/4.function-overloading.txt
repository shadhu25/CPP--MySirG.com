How Function overloading is resolved?
    First, C++ tries to find an exact match. This is the case where the actual argument exactly matches the parameter type of one of the overloaded functions.
    If no exact match is found, C++ tries to find a match through promotion
        char, unsihned char, and short is promoted to an int.
        float is promoted to double
    
    If no promotion is found , C++ tries to find a match through standard concersion
