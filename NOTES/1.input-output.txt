Output Instruction

    In C, standard Output device is monitor and printf() is use to send data/message to monitor.
    printf() is a predefined function.
    In C++, we can use cout to send data/message to monitor.
    cout is a predefined object.
    The operator << is called the insertion or put to operator.

    Example:-

    printf("Hello SCA");
    cout<<"Hello SCA";

    printf("sum of %d and %d is %d",a,b,c);
    cout<<"sum of "<<a<<" and "<<b<<" is "<<c;

    printf("%d",a+b);
    cout<<a+b;

Input Instruction

    In C, standard input device is keyboard and scanf() is use to recive data from keybord.
    scanf() is a predefined function.
    In C++, we can use cin to input data from keyboard.
    The identifier cin is a predefined object in C++.
    The operator >> is known as extraction operator or get from operator

    Example:-

    scanf("%d",&a);
    cin>>a;

    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    cin>>a>>b;

    scanf("%d%f",&a,&c);
    cin>>a>>c;

Remember

    According to the ANSI standards for C language, explicit declation of functio is recomended but mendatory.

    ANSI standards for C++ language says explicit declation of function ic compusory.

Header Files

    Predefined functions are declared in header files, so whenever you are using any predefined function in your code, you have to include specific header file that contains its declation.

About iostream

    We need to include header file iostream, it contains declations for the identifier cout and the operator<< and also for the identifier cin and operator >>.
    Header file contains declation of identifiers.
    Identifiers can be function names, variables, objects, macros etc.

About endl

    Inserting endl into the output stream causes the screen cursor to move to beginning of the next line.
    endl is a manipulator and it is declared in iostream.
    \n character also works as it works in C.
