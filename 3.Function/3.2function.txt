Benefits of Functions
    Easy to read
    Easy to modify
    Avoids rewriting of same code
    Easy to utilization

Functions save memory
    Function in a program is to save memory space which becomes appreciable when a function is likely to be called many times.

Functions are time consuming
    However every tie a function is called, it takes lot of extra time in executing a series of instructions for tasks such as jumping to the functions, saving registers, pushing arguments into the stack and returning to the cslling function.
    So, when function is small it is worthless to spend so much extra time in such tasks in cost of saving comparatively small space.

Inline Function
    To eliminate the cost of calls to small functions, C++ proposes a new featre called inline function.
    An inline functionis a function that is expanded in line when it is invoked.
    Compiler reolaces the function call with the corresponding function code.

    Inline is a request
        Inline is a request not a command.
        The Benefit of speed of inline functions reduces as the function grows in size.
        So the Compiler may ignore the request in some situations.
        Few of them:-
            Function containing loops, switch, goto.
            Functions with recursion.
            Containing static variable.

Examle:-

    #include<iostream>
    inline void fun();
    int main(){
        cout<<"You are in main"<<endl;
        fun();
    }
    void fun(){
        cout<<"You are in fun"<<endl;
    }
